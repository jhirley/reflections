1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	to colaborate with others and to avoid famous murphy's butterfly effect being a grain of sand blows a butterfly off course, causing it to be sucked into the intake of a 747 carrying a cargo of live african rinos, the engine ceases, the plain explodes and the live african rino hurtles throught the air and lands on your laptop with the only copy of your code.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?  

	It allows you to have ready code pushed instead of work in progress.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	branch: is a split of the code base on the same repo for { dev/feature/bugfix}
	clone: is a copy of a repo from the web to local or local to local
	fork: is a clone from Git repo to a new git repo ( no local )

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	changes and versions can be worked on.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	not really sure, I guess lots of review time lookin at code and code conflicts,  harder and longer
